Cassandra was the daughter of the king of Troy, and the god Apollo gave her the ability of prophecy. She, however, angered the god, and he turned her gift into a curse—she could see the future, but no one would believe her. Subsequently, when she tried to warn the Trojans not to accept the mysterious giant horse left outside their gates, they didn't listen, which, of course, had disastrous consequences.

So Cassandra's myth is invoked in the present day whenever someone made a prediction that turned out to be correct, but no one believed them. It's also sometimes used in psychology to describe the feelings of people whose accounts of distressing events aren't believed.</div></div><div class="a345 a301  a346"></div></div></div></div><div class="a308 a307 a347 a312 a309"><div class="a336" style="padding:24px 24px 12px 24px !important"><h6 class="a127 a350 a138"> <span>Promoted </span> in <span><a class="a127 a121 a123 a150" href="https://www.answers.com/t/Answers">Answers</a></span> </h6><h2 class="a127 a351 a133" style="margin-bottom:4px;font-size:29px">Can I upload images on Answers.com?</h2><h6 class="a127 a352 a138">Yes!

Space bathroom technology has come a long way over the years (there was a time when astronauts only had adhesive plastic bags as bathrooms), but it's still not exactly comfortable. Aboard the International Space Station, the toilets are designed with no gravity in mind—they use funnels, narrow openings, and vacuums to make sure the waste is contained. 

Astronauts even go through special toilet training to make sure they can use the space potty properly, since it's kind of fragile and very expensive—NASA bought one for $19 million in 2008.</div></div><div class="a345 a301  a346"></div></div></div></div><div class="a308 a307 card a294 a312 a309"><div class="a336 a295"><div class="a7 a296 a8 a14"><h6 class="a127 a289 a138" id="card-header"> <span> <!-- --> <!-- -->Asked by <!-- --> <a class="a127 a121 a123 a150" href="https://www.answers.com/u/winstonstehr"> <!-- -->Winston Stehr</a> <!-- --> <!-- --> in <!-- --> </span> <span><a class="a127 a121 a123 a150" href="/t/world-war-2">World War 2<!-- -->,</a> </span><span><a class="a127 a121 a123 a150" href="/t/war-and-military-history">War and Military History<!-- -->,</a> </span><span><a class="a127 a121 a123 a150" href="/t/d-day">D-Day</a> </span> </h6><a class="a127 a121 a122 question-title a150" href="https://www.answers.com/Q/What_does_the_D_stand_for_in_D_Day" id="question-title"><h3 class="a127 a290 a288 a133" label="What does the D stand for in D-Day">What does the D stand for in D-Day<!-- -->?</h3></a><div class="a290" id="inner-gutters"><a><img class="a342 a389 avatar-img" alt="User Avatar" src="https://img.answers.com/answ/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,dpr_2.0,w_32,h_32/v1573840443/avatars/default.png"/></a><div class="a127 a290 a337 a338 a340 a129">What does the "D" in D-Day stand for?
The "D" does not stand for "Deliverance", "Doom", "Debarkation"
or similar words. In fact, it does not stand for anything. The "D"
is derived from the word "Day". "D-Day" means the day on which a
military operation begins. The term "D-Day" has been used for many
different operations, but it is now generally only used to refer to
the Allied landings in Normandy on 6 June 1944.
Why was the expression "D-Day" used?
When a military operation is being planned, its actual date and
time is not always known exactly. The term "D-Day" was therefore
used to mean the date on which operations would begin, whenever
that was to be. The day before D-Day was known as "D-1", while the
day after D-Day was "D+1", and so on. This meant that if the
projected date of an operation changed, all the dates in the plan
did not also need to be changed. This actually happened in the case
of the Normandy Landings. D-Day in Normandy was originally intended
to be on 5 June 1944, but at the last minute bad weather delayed it
until the following day. The armed forces also used the expression
"H-Hour" for the time during the day at which operations were to
begin.

Dubhe and Merak, the stars on the outer side of the Big Dipper's basin, are sometimes called The Pointers because they point toward Polaris, also known as the North Star. On their own, the seven stars of the Big Dipper form an asterism (a relatively small pattern of stars), not a constellation. However, they're also part of Ursa Major, a true constellation, forming the bear's hips and tail.

A single red flag usually indicates that the water is hazardous, and swimming is discouraged but still technically allowed. Unless you're a very strong swimmer, it's wise to stay out of the water when there's a red flag. Two red flags means no swimming is allowed, signifying the highest danger level.

Several states have adopted dinosaurs as mascots, like the Utahraptor for Utah (duh) or the Sonorasaurus for Arizona. The trend started in the '90s as the Jurassic Park craze raged, but states have added official dinosaurs as recently as 2018. 

Some other state dinos of note are the Hypsibema missouriensis, whose vertebrae were Missouri's first known dinosaur discovery, and the Arkansaurus fridayi, whose foot bones are the only known dinosaur bones found in Arkansas.</div></div><div class="a345 a301  a346"></div></div></div></div><div class="a308 a307 card a294 a312 a309"><div class="a336 a295"><div class="a7 a296 a8 a14"><h6 class="a127 a289 a138" id="card-header"> <span> <!-- -->Asked in <!-- --> <!-- --> </span> <span><a class="a127 a121 a123 a150" href="/t/linguistics">Linguistics</a> </span> </h6><a class="a127 a121 a122 question-title a150" href="https://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_OK_short_for" id="question-title"><h3 class="a127 a290 a288 a133" label="What is OK short for">What is OK short for<!-- -->?</h3></a><div class="a290" id="inner-gutters"><a><img class="a342 a395 avatar-img" alt="User Avatar" src="https://img.answers.com/answ/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,dpr_2.0,w_32,h_32/v1573840443/avatars/default.png"/></a><div class="a127 a290 a337 a338 a340 a129">The most accepted theory is that “OK” is an acronym for “oll korrect,” an intentional misspelling of “all correct.” The acronym first appeared (at least in print) in a Boston newspaper in 1839, a time when it was trendy for writers to misspell and abbreviate words. Other examples from that time include “KG” which stood for “know go” or “no go,” and “AW” for “all write” or “all right.” 

From there, the theory states, it was helped along by the abbreviation of President Martin Van Buren’s nickname during his campaign—”Old Kinderhook”—and telegraph operators, as they preferred the two-letter “OK” to the three-letter “yes.”

But there are plenty of other theories. Some believe the phrase came from the Choctaw Native Americans, who have an expression in their language “okeh,” meaning “it is right.” The French had something similar, as well. West Africans, too, had “OK”-sounding expressions across many languages, and because of the forced illiteracy of many slaves, it could be that it didn’t make its way into writing until it had been co-opted by white Americans.</div></div><div class="a345 a301  a346"></div></div></div></div><div class="a308 a307 card a294 a312 a309"><div class="a336 a295"><div class="a7 a296 a8 a14"><h6 class="a127 a289 a138" id="card-header"> <span> <!-- -->Asked in <!-- --> <!-- --> </span> <span><a class="a127 a121 a123 a150" href="/t/psychosomatic-therapy">Psychosomatic Therapy</a> </span> </h6><a class="a127 a121 a122 question-title a150" href="https://www.answers.com/Q/Is_it_possible_to_die_of_a_broken_heart" id="question-title"><h3 class="a127 a290 a288 a133" label="Is it possible to die of a broken heart">Is it possible to die of a broken heart<!-- -->?</h3></a><div class="a290" id="inner-gutters"><a><img class="a342 a396 avatar-img" alt="User Avatar" src="https://img.answers.com/answ/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,dpr_2.0,w_32,h_32/v1573840443/avatars/default.png"/></a><div class="a127 a290 a337 a338 a340 a129">Yes, but it's very rare. “Broken heart syndrome,” otherwise known as stress cardiomyopathy or takotsubo cardiomyopathy, manifests itself as intense chest pain that comes on suddenly as a reaction to a surge of stress hormones. This is caused by an emotionally stressful event, such as the death of a loved one or even something positive like winning the lottery. Unlike a heart attack, there’s no evidence of blocked arteries in broken heart syndrome. Additionally, blood tests show no sign of heart damage. 

While many who experience broken heart syndrome make a full recovery, the condition is sometimes fatal. It has been speculated that actress Debbie Reynolds, who died one day after her daughter Carrie Fisher, and Johnny Cash, who died within months of wife, June Carter Cash, suffered from the syndrome.

The purpose of a car muffler is to silence the car’s exhaust system—in fact, in the UK, they’re called silencers—and most are pretty successful. The loud ones are either faulty, modified to be loud, or are something called “performance mufflers,” which are designed to increase car performance and split the gap between, well, muffled and unmuffled.

So, your average muffler eliminates most of the exhaust noise by leading sound waves through sound-cancelling channels and chambers; modified and performance mufflers, on the other hand, let some of the cool sounds out.

If your muffler isn’t usually loud but starts to make noise, get that checked right away, as that could mean harmful fumes are leaking into your car.

That’s almost 8 percent of the estimated total for the entire year. This is the biggest drop in emissions in recent history, which sounds promising—some polluted cities are even seeing smog-free skies.

Unfortunately, this is a drop in the bucket compared to the long-term changes that would need to be made to reverse the damage to our environment. As the threat of COVID-19 starts to fade, people will likely get back to their daily lives, and emissions will return to the status quo. 

“Broadly speaking, the only real times we've seen large emission reductions globally in the past few decades is during major recessions,” said Zeke Hausfather, the director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute. “But even then, the effects are often smaller than you think. It generally doesn't lead to any sort of systematic change.”

There's some dispute over where the border between the continents actually is (in Russia and beyond), but most people say the part of Russia west of the Ural Mountains is European and the eastern part is Asian. That means more of Russia's landmass is in Asia, but more of the population lives in Europe, as the biggest cities, Moscow and St. Petersburg, are both on the European side.If this frustrates youâ€”"Why can't everything fit cleanly into our categories!"â€”I have bad news. Russia isn't the only country that spans multiple continents; Egypt, Greece, and Turkey do it, too.

Some parrots, for example, seem to identify themselves with specific sets of peeps, and it's possible their parents give them those names. Sweet, right?

And parrots aren't the only animals we suspect name each other. Dolphins also have distinctive whistles that function similarly to names. To prove this, researchers played a variety of whistles to a group of dolphins, and the individuals only replied to their signature sound, as if they were calling back when their name had been called.</div></div><div class="a345 a301  a346"></div></div></div></div><div class="a308 a307 card a294 a312 a309"><div class="a336 a295"><div class="a7 a296 a8 a14"><h6 class="a127 a289 a138" id="card-header"> <span> <!-- -->Asked in <!-- --> <!-- --> </span> <span><a class="a127 a121 a123 a150" href="/t/health">Health</a> </span> </h6><a class="a127 a121 a122 question-title a150" href="https://www.answers.com/Q/What_does_the_term_morbidly_obese_mean" id="question-title"><h3 class="a127 a290 a288 a133" label="What does the term morbidly obese mean">What does the term morbidly obese mean<!-- -->?</h3></a><div class="a290" id="inner-gutters"><a><img class="a342 a406 avatar-img" alt="User Avatar" src="https://img.answers.com/answ/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,dpr_2.0,w_32,h_32/v1573840443/avatars/default.png"/></a><div class="a127 a290 a337 a338 a340 a129">A morbidly obese person is someone who is very overweight to the

In places like France and the Mediterranean, breakfast was (and is) a light meal. A traditional English or American breakfast, however, is much heavier, with heaping mounds of eggs and meat. A “continental breakfast” was meant to cater to the tastes of those in mainland Europe who preferred a smaller breakfast, and it stuck, in no small part because the central items require little oversight and have a decent shelf life.

Netflix's founders offered to sell their company to Blockbuster, and when they mentioned their price tag of $50 million, Blockbuster’s CEO stifled a laugh and ultimately turned them down.

Ten years later, Blockbuster went out of business; that same year, Netflix, by then in the streaming game, brought in over $2 billion in revenue.
